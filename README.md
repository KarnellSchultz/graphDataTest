# graphDataTest
this is a MVP to see how to create a js graph using chart.js 


Features to add:

Add a few other lines to the graph. Maybe northern and souther hemispher data. Maybe attempt to create some kind of silly corilation between this nasa data and some totally unrealted data.

"Maximum observed snow depth at Stockholm Observatory each winter

column 1 : year when December falls

Future idea on what to do with graph data: 
- Maybe attemt to find a trend in global temps and stockholm snow.
